SYSTEM  = Si DFT unoccupied states

ISMEAR  = 0      ! Gaussian smearing
SIGMA   = 0.05   ! smearing in eV, small sigma is required to avoid partial occupancies
ENCUT   = 400    ! energy cutoff

NBANDS  = 64     ! maybe even more bands 

ALGO    = Exact  ! use exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian
NELM    = 1      ! since we are already converged stop after one step

  LOPTICS = T      ! write WAVEDER
